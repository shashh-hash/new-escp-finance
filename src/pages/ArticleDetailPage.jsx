        <SectionHeading>A High-Profile Deal Shaking the Tech Sector</SectionHeading>
        <BodyParagraph>
          Bending Spoons’ latest move has stirred significant attention across both the tech and financial
          sectors. The Milan-based company, already known for its bold and strategic acquisition approach,
          has agreed to acquire Eventbrite for $500 million in cash, marking one of its most high-profile
          deals to date. The offer of $4.50 per share represents an 81–82% premium over the current market
          price, signaling strong confidence in Eventbrite’s long-term potential despite the platform’s
          recent challenges and periods of underperformance. Analysts and investors alike have interpreted
          the deal as a statement of intent by Bending Spoons to solidify its position in the global events
          economy and to leverage its technological capabilities to revitalize mature digital brands.

        <SectionHeading>Eventbrite's Journey and Recent Challenges</SectionHeading>
        <BodyParagraph>
          Eventbrite, which once boasted a valuation exceeding $1.7 billion during its 2018 IPO, has long
          been seen as a pioneer of the experience economy. The platform’s original mission was to
          democratize event management, enabling organizers of all sizes to host, manage, and monetize
          events seamlessly. However, in the years following its public debut, Eventbrite faced multiple
          headwinds. Declining volumes of live events, increasing competition from emerging digital
          solutions, and the prolonged disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic challenged its business
          model. Consequently, Eventbrite’s market performance suffered, with shares consistently trading
          far below their historic highs and the company grappling with operational inefficiencies and
          revenue pressures.
        </BodyParagraph>

        <SectionHeading>Bending Spoons’ Strategy for Revitalizing Digital Brands</SectionHeading>
        <BodyParagraph>
          The acquisition offer from Bending Spoons, while generous, aligns closely with its broader
          corporate strategy. Over the past decade, Bending Spoons has cultivated a reputation for acquiring
          mature digital brands, optimizing their operational structures, and integrating its proprietary
          AI-driven technologies to reinvigorate growth. By leveraging data analytics, user engagement
          insights, and advanced product design, the company has been able to enhance user retention, expand
          monetization avenues, and modernize legacy platforms. Industry observers note that Bending Spoons’
          approach combines financial acumen with a tech-first mindset, creating a blueprint for reviving
          established but stagnating digital businesses.
        </BodyParagraph>

        <SectionHeading>A Rare Display of Financial Power in European Tech</SectionHeading>
        <BodyParagraph>
          More than anything, this acquisition underscores Bending Spoons’ formidable financial resources.
          In 2025, the company raised $710 million in new equity, boosting its valuation to $11 billion, and
          secured nearly $2.8 billion in debt financing. This combination of equity and debt not only
          provides ample liquidity for strategic acquisitions but also signals the company’s readiness to
          compete with global giants in the tech sector. Such a financial position is rare for a European
          technology firm, particularly one outside the traditional startup ecosystem. The capital base
          equips Bending Spoons with the flexibility to pursue both opportunistic acquisitions and long-term
          strategic initiatives without jeopardizing operational stability.

        <SectionHeading>The Transformation Ahead for Eventbrite</SectionHeading>
        <BodyParagraph>
          Under the leadership of CEO Luca Ferrari, Eventbrite is expected to undergo a significant
          strategic and technological transformation. Key initiatives will likely include the modernization
          of the platform through AI-enhanced tools, the development of more efficient monetization models
          for event organizers, and deeper integration with Bending Spoons’ existing ecosystem of digital
          assets. Analysts suggest that these transformations could position Eventbrite not only as a market
          leader in event management but also as a more resilient and scalable platform capable of weathering
          fluctuations in demand and evolving consumer preferences.
        </BodyParagraph>

        <SectionHeading>A New Era of European Tech Consolidators</SectionHeading>
        <BodyParagraph>
          The acquisition also illustrates a broader trend in the European tech landscape: the emergence of
          a new class of tech consolidators capable of acquiring, scaling, and integrating digital brands at
          a level previously seen mainly in U.S.-based tech holding companies and private equity funds. By
          combining operational expertise, technological innovation, and substantial financial firepower,
          companies like Bending Spoons are reshaping the way digital platforms grow and compete globally.
          This development could inspire similar strategies across Europe, potentially leading to increased
          consolidation in digital sectors that have historically been fragmented.
        </BodyParagraph>

        <SectionHeading>A Timely Bet on the Experience Economy</SectionHeading>
        <BodyParagraph>
          Financially, the acquisition is notable not just for its premium but also for its strategic
          timing. The events industry, while resilient, has been recovering unevenly from pandemic
          disruptions, with hybrid events, live experiences, and virtual engagement platforms emerging as
          critical growth areas. By securing Eventbrite now, Bending Spoons positions itself to capture
          value in both traditional and innovative event formats, combining established infrastructure with
          modern digital enhancements. Investors view this move as a forward-looking bet on the long-term
          recovery and expansion of the experience economy, rather than a short-term financial maneuver.
        </BodyParagraph>

        <SectionHeading>Long-Term Implications for Both Companies</SectionHeading>
        <BodyParagraph>
          In conclusion, Bending Spoons’ $500 million acquisition of Eventbrite represents a strategically
          significant move for both companies. It underscores the Milan-based firm’s growing financial and
          technological influence while offering Eventbrite a path toward renewed growth, modernization, and
          competitive relevance. As Eventbrite undergoes transformation under Luca Ferrari’s leadership, the
          industry will be watching closely to see how effectively Bending Spoons can integrate its
          proprietary technologies, optimize operational efficiencies, and expand Eventbrite’s market
          footprint. This acquisition signals the emergence of a new paradigm in European tech, one defined
          by bold investment, strategic consolidation, and a focus on long-term value creation.

        S&amp;P DOWNGRADES TETHER’S ASSETS TO LOWEST LEVEL
      </LeadParagraph>

      <SectionHeading>A Critical Moment for the World’s Largest Stablecoin</SectionHeading>
      <BodyParagraph>
        S&amp;P Global Ratings has downgraded the reserves backing Tether’s stablecoin USDT to its
        lowest assessment level, raising new concerns about the stability of the world’s largest
        digital dollar token.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        Tether issues USDT, a cryptocurrency designed to stay equal in value to the U.S. dollar
        through a mechanism known as a “peg”, which means that one USDT should always be
        redeemable for one dollar.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        With around $184 billion outstanding, USDT plays a central role in the global crypto
        ecosystem, particularly in emerging markets where access to real dollars is limited. The
        downgrade represents a crucial moment in how traditional financial institutions assess the
        risks behind Tether’s reserve structure.
      </BodyParagraph>

      <SectionHeading>Rising Risk Exposure and Transparency Gaps</SectionHeading>
      <BodyParagraph>
        S&amp;P lowered its rating from 4 (constrained) to 5 (weak), citing two main issues: a
        rising share of high-risk assets in Tether’s reserves and persistent gaps in transparency.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        According to the agency, assets such as bitcoin, gold, secured loans and corporate bonds
        accounted for 24% of Tether’s reserves at the end of September, compared with 17% a year
        earlier. Bitcoin alone represents 5.6% while Tether’s surplus reserves amount to only 3.9%.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        S&amp;P warned that if bitcoin or other volatile assets fall sharply, the reserves could
        temporarily become insufficient to fully back all USDT in circulation, making it harder to
        maintain the “peg”. The rating agency also noted that Tether provides little information
        about the reliability of the banks and custodians holding its reserves and offers few
        details on how it values its more complex investments.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        Despite these concerns, most of Tether’s reserves remain in high-quality assets such as
        U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents which currently make up around 77% of the total. S&amp;P
        acknowledged that USDT has shown strong stability during major stress events, including
        crypto market crashes and exchange failures.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        However, the agency stated that the growing share of higher-risk assets makes USDT more
        vulnerable to market swings, and the downgrade comes at a time when the crypto sector is
        already under pressure, with bitcoin down roughly 30% since early October. Analysts added
        that worries about Tether’s reserves have increased uncertainty in the market, as further
        declines in bitcoin could weaken the value of the assets backing the stablecoin.
      </BodyParagraph>

      <SectionHeading>Tether Pushes Back Against S&amp;P’s Framework</SectionHeading>
      <BodyParagraph>
        Tether strongly disagreed with S&amp;P’s assessment, saying that the agency uses a
        traditional finance framework that does not reflect how digital assets operate. The company
        pointed to its history of maintaining stability through market turbulence and highlighted
        its real-time reserve reporting and quarterly attestations by BDO Italy.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        That said, Tether still does not provide full independent audits, which remains a key
        concern for analysts and regulators.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, criticized the downgrade even more directly, writing that the
        company “wears your loathing with pride”. He argued that legacy credit-rating models are
        outdated and that Tether’s “overcapitalized” structure challenges traditional finance,
        although analysts noted that these statements did not address the specific transparency
        gaps raised by S&amp;P.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <QuoteBlock>
        « Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, criticized the downgrade even more directly, writing that
        the company “wears your loathing with pride”. »
      </QuoteBlock>
      <SectionHeading>Expansion Risks and a New U.S. Regulatory Landscape</SectionHeading>
      <BodyParagraph>
        Additional questions have emerged regarding Tether’s expansion into other sectors such as
        energy, data, finance and education. S&amp;P said it is unclear whether these operations
        are financially separate from the stablecoin business, which may introduce additional risks
        compared with more regulated competitors like Circle, the issuer of USDC.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        Regulation is also tightening in the U.S. through the new GENIUS Act, which requires
        stablecoins to be backed entirely by short-dated U.S. Treasuries and other liquid assets.
      </BodyParagraph>
      <BodyParagraph>
        This framework aligns more closely with the reserve structure of other issuers, while
        Tether continues to hold secured loans (still 8% of reserves, or over $14 billion,
        according to BDO Italy) despite earlier promises to eliminate them.
      </BodyParagraph>

      <SectionHeading>Growing Scrutiny on the USDT Model</SectionHeading>
      <BodyParagraph>
        In conclusion, S&amp;P’s downgrade highlights mounting concerns over the clarity and
        stability of the reserves backing USDT. Tether insists on its resilience, yet its growing
        exposure to volatile assets raises questions that remain unanswered. As the stablecoin
        industry matures, only time will tell whether USDT’s model can withstand increasing
        scrutiny and shifting market conditions.

        A 10 billion dollar transaction insert Pfizer in the business of Anti-Obesity drugs
      </LeadParagraph>

      <BodyParagraph>
        The American Pharmaceutical company Pfizer had completed the acquisition of the obesity drugs
        start-up Metsera for nearly 10 billion dollars overcoming its strongest competitor the Danish
        company Novo Nordisk. Pfizer is the fourth Pharma Company for revenues in 2024, with 63.5
        billion dollars in revenues and 45.7 billion dollars in gross profit in 2024. At the date of
        this Article publication, its shares have a value of nearly 22 dollars and its market cap is
        142.37 billion dollars placing it at the 11th place in market cap ranking for Pharma companies.
      </BodyParagraph>

      <SectionHeading>The M&amp;A Battle for Metsera</SectionHeading>

      <BodyParagraph>
        This strife for Metsera acquisition started nearly two months ago at the end of September with
        the first offer made by Pfizer of 7.3 billion dollars. Afterward, an unexpected offer was
        performed by the Danish Pharma company at the end of October and after a period of legal
        challenges the bidding was won by the American company with a deal worth 2.7 billion dollars
        more than the previous agreement from September. On the 7th of November, the New-York based
        company announced the acquisition of Metsera. From a technical point of view, Pfizer bought all
        the outstanding Metsera shares for 86.25 dollars per share in cash. This price was a premium of
        3.69% to Metsera’s Friday, the 7th of November, close that was 83.18 dollars per share. This
        amount was composed of a base of 65.60 dollars per share in cash, that represented a value of
        nearly 7.0 billion dollars. To this amount, they could add a contingent value right (CVR), a
        contractual right should certain future events or milestones be met, of up to 20.65 dollars per
        share if they were to achieve three specified clinical and regulatory milestones. After the
        acquisition Metsera became a subsidiary of Pfizer causing an end to the trading of Metsera
        shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

        (RA) ready to begin Phase 3 research phase. Then Metsera is also developing a Phase 1 drug
        MET-233i, a monthly amylin analog, to be used both in monotherapy and in combination with the
        previous cited drug. Finally, they have an oral GLP-1 RA still in Phase 1 development and a
        preclinical drug composed by a nutrient-stimulated hormone. Citi for the financial part and
        Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz for the legal one advised Pfizer for this transaction.

      <SectionHeading>Strategic Rationale</SectionHeading>

      <BodyParagraph>
        Even though it will take some time for Metsera drugs to enter effectively into the market and
        its obesity treatments still are in an early-stage development, confirming its unproven
        efficiency, many are the reasons for this acquisition. Firstly, Leerink Partners analyst David
        Risinger projected that Metsera’s two top drugs, MET-097i and MET-233i might reach $5 billion in
        combined peak sales. Secondly, they will put Pfizer into a market whose value will reach 150
        billion dollars at its peak in the next decade in accordance with projections of a Morgan Stanley
        Research. Nevertheless, Courtney Breen, a Bernstein analyst, stated that this high price was full
        of optimism, reinforcing the fact that Pfizer must reach 11 billion dollars in revenue by 2040,
        nearly doubling Metsera’s current projections.

      <SectionHeading>Metsera’s Financial Profile</SectionHeading>

      <BodyParagraph>
        Concerning the acquired start-up, the Metsera Company was founded in 2022 and it has always been
        highly focused in development of treatment for obesity and metabolic diseases. Its financial
        statements of the past two years showed a net loss of 47.2 million dollars in 2023 that
        increased to 209.1 million dollars in 2024. This can be explained by the completely absence of
        revenues and an high expense in Research and Development. Its total assets increased to 450.9
        million in 2024, whose 80% is Cash and Cash Receivables. Moreover, its debt to equity ratio was
        nearly 0.6 for 2024. At the end of 2024, they increase cash amount of 278.1 million caused mainly
        by stock issuance due to the negative cash from operating activity of 100 million dollars.

        In conclusion, this acquisition worth 10 billion dollars allows Pfizer to enter the obesity drug
        market getting closer to two leader Pharma companies in this market, Eli Lilly and Company and
        Novo Nordisk.
